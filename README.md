# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a simple component with an optimal layout depending on the user's device's screen size.

## How it went

I completed the challenge using some simple css. I don't think it's anything special but it was a nice exercice anyway. In case you're curious how I did you may see the outcome [here](https://frontendmentor-social-proof-section-nuerqe2cr-adammintaj.vercel.app/)
